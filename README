[Serious warning: I wrote this code more than six years ago. It is most
likely suffering from severe bitrot by now and you really should not be
using Apache 1.3 anymore.]


mod_no_prefetch
===============

May 2005

Introduction
------------

This module is a simple blocker for requests originating from 
Mozilla's prefetch feature [1] or Google Web Accelerator [2].

The module has been written and is maintained by Martin Jansen
(martin@divbyzero.net).

Installation
------------

To enable it, download the module and unzip it in the src/modules
subdirectory of your Apache source tree.  It can then be compiled
into Apache using the following ./configure options:

./configure --activate-module=src/modules/no_prefetch/mod_no_prefetch.c --enable-module=no_prefetch

Configuration
-------------

Currently there is no way to configure the module.  It will just
block all requests that match the pattern.
